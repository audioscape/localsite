# Local DataUSA.io

Clone the [datausa-site repo](https://github.com/DataUSA/datausa-site)  

Run the following within your local datausa-site folder.  

Setup the environment:

	python3 -m venv .env

Run one of these:

OSX / Linux:

	source .env/bin/activate

Windows:

	\.env\Scripts\activate.bat

Install dependencies

	pip install -r requirements.txt

Install dependencies (generates node_modules folder)

	yarn install

Issue: package-lock.json found. Your project contains lock files generated by tools other than Yarn. It is advised not to mix package managers in order to avoid resolution inconsistencies caused by unsynchronized lock files. To clear this warning, remove package-lock.json.  

So what do we run instead of `yarn install`?

Launch site

	python -m http.server 8888

View at [http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/)  

Which .py script do we need to run next to view the site???

# County Industry Data Prep  

The following documents how to generate a CSV file containing BLS data pulled from the [EPA's Flowsa API](https://datacommons.org).  

## BLS Data Preparation 

The steps below have been applied in our [Google CoLab for exploring NAICS](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HLK4HIUMLlgTR524QoCKvfaNl-La48XU?usp=sharing) which can be used to output 6-digit naics by state to a [CSV file](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1EoWDvNoaKO8xLclX4fr5exw83jJkkJIy) on Google Drive which Loren manually converted to a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P7XzybX4IDquCIzCaXBTQc6flF6Dkk2eSOulVnArnSg/edit#gid=1784806891) and [sorted by employment](https://github.com/modelearth/localsite/blob/master/map/naics/2018-6digit-ga.csv).  The original Python also resides in our [FLOWSA fork](https://github.com/modelearth/flowsa/tree/master/colabs).

U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) industry data  
BLS data is pulled using the [FLOWSA Python script](https://github.com/USEPA/flowsa/blob/master/flowsa/BLS_QCEW.py)
maintained by Catherine Birney.

If you change BLS_QCEW.py, do so in our [FLOWSA fork](https://github.com/modelearth/flowsa).

Check for 6-digit 336111 automobile industry NAICS when outputting using FLOWSA.  
Note that only 4-digit NAICS resides in "By-Industry" in [BLS downloadable files](https://www.bls.gov/cew/downloadable-data-files.htm).  


Output to [state data files](https://github.com/modelearth/community-data/tree/master/us/state)    

Output 5 columns with names: fips, naics, employees, wages and firms (establishment count)

- fips - Location (fips for county)  
- naics - ActivityProducedBy (6-digit naics)  
- employees - Employment FlowAmount (Number of Employees)  
- wages - Money (Annual Wages)
- firms - Other (Number of Extablishments)
